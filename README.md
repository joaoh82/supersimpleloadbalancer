# Super Simple Load Balancer

Super Simple Load Balancer is as the name say a super simple Load Balancer created to illustrate the basic features in any load balancer you might find out there.

It uses Round Robin Algorithm for backend selection with support for retries too.

It supports active and passive Health Checks as well as cleaning and recovery of backends.

Doesn't have anything fancy like https or weighted round-robin or least connections algorithms, maybe in the next iteration.

## How to use

```bash
Usage:
  -backends string
        Load balanced backends, use commas to separate
  -port int
        Port to serve (default 3030)
```
Example:

To add followings as load balanced backends
- http://localhost:3031
- http://localhost:3032
- http://localhost:3033
- http://localhost:3034
```bash
% super-simple-load-balancer --backends=http://localhost:3031,http://localhost:3032,http://localhost:3033,http://localhost:3034
```

### Or with Docker-Compose

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
% docker-compose up
